# CodingChallenges

This is a WIP repo meant to keep up with Daniel Shiffman's weekly [Coding Challenges](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH). There will be an emphasis to vary it and take tangents from the original code, as well as attempting to realize a physical medium of some of the geometric ideas presented.

I have made the following table as a checklist to go through the videos, but I won't be going in chronological order. Instead, I will be going in order of topics that more interesting to myself while also keeping up with latest coding livestream. 

# Tweaks
* [ ] Following along with this tutorial for [python game of life and reaction diffusion](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/numpy/numpy.html).
