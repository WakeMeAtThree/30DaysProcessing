1,Placeholder Debut,This is the debut sketch to start off this repo.,:white_check_mark:,,
2,Square shift,Building upon the previous sketch and adding a square motion.,:white_check_mark:,,
3,Steering Trails Blur GLSL,Testing out filter blur GLSL shader by applying it to steering trails.,:white_check_mark:,,
4,Ten Print Class,"Factoring out a ten print sketch into its own class, testing blur shader on it.",:white_check_mark:,,
5,JSON streamer,"Ball bouncing class written in python that runs and streams to a json, with a processing sketch that visualizes contents of json in real time. Experimenting with ways of connecting both languages.",:white_check_mark:,,:white_check_mark:
6,Blur Filter expanded,"Added more kernels to the glsl example in the processing Blur Filter example, as well as discovered a neat trick to have changes to glsl files update immediately, thus giving a better feedback as you play around with glsl code. This could be a great tutorial or p5js sketch for others to learn glsl as well.",:white_check_mark:,,
7,Line Twirls,"I'm quite busy today to think of a more elaborate sketch, so here's a simple line twirling with changing colors.",:white_check_mark:,,
8,Spiral Lerp,Mixing two colors as a point turns around the middle of the canvas. ,:white_check_mark:,,
9,Octagonal Module,"Module for an octagonal shifting edges module, inspired by hexes sketch by Dave Whyte",:white_check_mark:,,
10,Octagonal Module Tiled,Module tiled on the canvas,:white_check_mark:,,
11,Octagonal Module Tiled with Distance Field,Module tiled on the canvas with distance field,:white_check_mark:,,
12,Octagonal Module Class,,:white_check_mark:,,
13,Lerp tricks,Playing around with lerp and delay following the Etienne Jacob's tutorial on using lerp for some interesting effects,:white_check_mark:,,
14,Polygonal Tunnel,Created a polygonal tunnel sketch after being inspired by some of hexiosis gifs,:white_check_mark:,,
15,Radial Field,"Created a center radial field effect. Useful tool in future processing sketches. ~~Need to translate to java, as I struggled to figure out a way of sorting in java that is as intuitive as python.~~ Translated to java after getting help from /processing subreddit (Thanks, mrsirrisrm!)",:white_check_mark:,,:white_check_mark:
16,Hammer Time,Followed along with [Jeremy Behreandt’s] (https://medium.com/@behreajj/3d-models-in-processing-7d968a7cede5) medium article on basic material properties for 3d shapes in processing. Created a sample geometry to play with in processing. ,,,
17,To be determined,To do: better ways of controlling saveFrame and gif quality,,,
