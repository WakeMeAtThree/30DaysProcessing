# 30 Days of Processing

I've been away to python land for a while, but I'm back to the java jungle. This repo is a daily commitment to *writing* a sketch a day in processing, no matter how simple or basic. 

My exploration started off around the GLSL shaders and geometry transformations. It then went through Daniel Shiffman coding challenges, then started to be inspired by the processing's twitter community. The open source community for processing is quite wonderful and generous with the knowledge they're providing, which I will try my best to name in this repository. 

# Useful tools and resources
- [Markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#)
- [Book of shaders](http://thebookofshaders.com/)
  - [Shaping functions](http://www.thebookofshaders.com/05/)
- [Andres Colubri's PShader tutorial](https://processing.org/tutorials/pshader/) as well as the accompanying [github repo](https://github.com/codeanticode/pshader-tutorials)
- [Shadershop for creating functions](http://tobyschachman.com/Shadershop/)
- [Color generator](https://coolors.co/) which is useful for generating some color palettes

# Post-repo ideas:
- Varying the CodingTrain CC's in its own repo (as well as a plan for plans for physical manifestations of it)
- Python implementation of one of these sketches using numpy + matplotlib

Experimenting with ways of connecting both languages.                                                                                                                | :white_check_mark:    |          | :white_check_mark: |
| 6      | Blur Filter expanded                       | Added more kernels to the glsl example in the processing Blur Filter example, as well as discovered a neat trick to have changes to glsl files update immediately, thus giving a better feedback as you play around with glsl code. This could be a great tutorial or p5js sketch for others to learn glsl as well. | :white_check_mark:    |          |                    |

Need to translate to java, as I struggled to figure out a way of sorting in java that is as intuitive as python.                                                                                                                   |                       |          | :white_check_mark: |
