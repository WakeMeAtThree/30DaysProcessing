# 30 Days of Processing

I've been away to python land for a while, but I'm back to the java jungle. This repo is a daily commitment to *writing* a sketch a day in processing, no matter how simple or basic. 

My current exploration has been around the GLSL shaders and geometry transformations.

| 1  | Placeholder Debut         | This is the debut sketch to start off this repo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | :white_check_mark:    |          |                    |
| 2  | Square shift              | Building upon the previous sketch and adding a square motion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | :white_check_mark:    |          |                    |
| 3  | Steering Trails Blur GLSL | Testing out filter blur GLSL shader by applying it to steering trails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | :white_check_mark:    |          |                    |
| 4  | Ten Print Class           | Factoring out a ten print sketch into its own class, testing blur shader on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | :white_check_mark:    |          |                    |
| 5  | JSON streamer             | Ball bouncing class written in python that runs and streams to a json, with a processing sketch that visualizes contents of json in real time. Experimenting with ways of connecting both languages.                                                                                                                | :white_check_mark:    |          | :white_check_mark: |
| 6  | Blur Filter expanded      | Added more kernels to the glsl example in the processing Blur Filter example, as well as discovered a neat trick to have changes to glsl files update immediately, thus giving a better feedback as you play around with glsl code. This could be a great tutorial or p5js sketch for others to learn glsl as well. | :white_check_mark:    |          |                    |
