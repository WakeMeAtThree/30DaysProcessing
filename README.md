# 30 Days of Processing
Hi.

I've been away to python land for a while, but I'm back to the java jungle. This repo is a daily commitment to *writing* a sketch a day in processing, no matter how simple or basic. 

My exploration started off around the GLSL shaders and geometry transformations. It then went through Daniel Shiffman coding challenges, then started to be inspired by the processing's twitter community. The open source community for processing is quite wonderful and generous with the knowledge they're providing, which I will try my best to name in this repository.

- [Another table generator](https://donatstudios.com/CsvToMarkdownTable)
- [Book of shaders](http://thebookofshaders.com/)
  - [Shaping functions](http://www.thebookofshaders.com/05/)
- [Andres Colubri's PShader tutorial](https://processing.org/tutorials/pshader/) as well as the accompanying [github repo](https://github.com/codeanticode/pshader-tutorials)
- [Shadershop for creating functions](http://tobyschachman.com/Shadershop/)
- [Color generator](https://coolors.co/) which is useful for generating some color palettes

# Post-repo ideas:
- Varying the CodingTrain CC's in its own repo (as well as a plan for plans for physical manifestations of it)
- Python implementation of one of these sketches using numpy + matplotlib
- Accompanying LQ/HQ gifs OR p5js translations for sharing online
- Default 3d model of my own for future use (elaborately intricate to accomodate different surface conditions)
- Observation: I'm gravitating more and more towards patterns-based sketches.
- Recreating classic games might also be a good idea to work towards

Created a sample geometry to play with in processing.                                                                                                               |  :white_check_mark:     |            |
17      |  Subtract Mode                               |  I've always looked at drawings and illustrations of Iakov Chernikov where he overlapping geometries and colored them in a way that is best described today as Subtract mode. This sketch illustrates the interesting variations achievement from this mode by applying it on a pattern of circles growing in radii and arranged in a hexagonal pattern.  |  :white_check_mark:     |            |

22      |  Tetris geometry                             |  2D implementation of tetris geometry I had in mind. This is the first step in setting up a 3D tetris tilings (likely to look more columnar)                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  :white_check_mark:     |            |
23      |  Circ-Tri morph tiled                        |  Fixed some coordinate issues with the svg file as well as tiled hexagonally the previous pattern in Difference mode (again!). Makes for some interesting output. I also left the x and y spacing variable depending on your mousePressed coordinates.                                                                                                    |  :white_check_mark:     |            |
