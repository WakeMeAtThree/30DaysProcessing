# 30 Days of Processing

I've been away to python land for a while, but I'm back to the java jungle. This repo is a daily commitment to *writing* a sketch a day in processing, no matter how simple or basic. 

My current exploration has been around the GLSL shaders and geometry transformations.

| 1  | Placeholder Debut         | This is the debut sketch to start off this repo.                                | :white_check_mark:    |          |
| 2  | Square shift              | Building upon the previous sketch and adding a square motion.                   | :white_check_mark:    |          |
| 3  | Steering Trails Blur GLSL | Testing out filter blur GLSL shader by applying it to steering trails.          | :white_check_mark:    |          |
| 4  | Ten Print Class           | Factoring out a ten print sketch into its own class, testing blur shader on it. | :white_check_mark:    |          |
