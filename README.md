# 30 Days of Processing
Hi.

I've been away to python land for a while, but I'm back to the java jungle. This repo is a daily commitment to *writing* a sketch a day in processing, no matter how simple or basic. 

My exploration started off around the GLSL shaders and geometry transformations. It then went through Daniel Shiffman coding challenges, then started to be inspired by the processing's twitter community. The open source community for processing is quite wonderful and generous with the knowledge they're providing, which I will try my best to name in this repository.

# Post-repo ideas:
- Varying the CodingTrain CC's in its own repo (as well as a plan for plans for physical manifestations of it)
- Python implementation of one of these sketches using numpy + matplotlib
- Accompanying LQ/HQ gifs OR p5js translations for sharing online
- Default 3d model of my own for future use (elaborately intricate to accomodate different surface conditions)
- Observation: I'm gravitating more and more towards patterns-based sketches.
- Recreating classic games might also be a good idea to work towards
- Take a look at this and [implement it in one of your sketches](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8200243/can-i-store-function-names-in-final-hashmap-for-execution/8200427).

# Useful code snippets

The following are useful `ffmpeg` commands for making animation gifs/mp4. 

Turning image sequence to a video
```
ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i animation%3d.png -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4
```

Concatenating two videos to create a reverse loop
```
ffmpeg -i input.mov -filter_complex "[0:v]reverse,fifo[r];[0:v][r] concat=n=2:v=1 [v]" -map "[v]" output.mp4
```

```
ffmpeg -i output.mp4 -vf palettegen palette.png
ffmpeg -ss 2.6 -t 1.3 -i output.mp4 -i palette.png -filter_complex “fps=30,scale=400:-1:flags=lanczos[x];[x][1:v]paletteuse” output.gif

22      |  Tetris geometry                             |  2D implementation of tetris geometry I had in mind. This is the first step in setting up a 3D tetris tilings (likely to look more columnar)                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  :white_check_mark:     |            |
23      |  Circ-Tri morph tiled                        |  Fixed some coordinate issues with the svg file as well as tiled hexagonally the previous pattern in Difference mode (again!). Makes for some interesting output. I also left the x and y spacing variable depending on your mousePressed coordinates.                                                                                                    |  :white_check_mark:     |            |
24      |  Circ-Tri morph with offset                  |  Added slight offset to previous circ-tri sketch                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  :white_check_mark:     |            |

# Final thoughts

~30 days of Processing~ finished on April 8th, 2018. Overall, it was a good haul and I picked up good tools for processing toolbox. Moving forward I'm planning to spin off some off these sketches into a series deserving of its own repo. There is a lot of things to mine from in modular/pattern based sketches. Unresolved issues include figuring out a way to move mesh vertices as if it's welded and more optimized gifs (though making good head way using ffmpeg). May revisit this to either check off p5js sketches or to turn this into 60 (accumulative) days of processing, or to just turn this into a processing playground.
